# 3D-Neuron-Segmentation

This project was a culmination of my masters project for training deep learning models for semantically segmenting 3d images of neurons for fast implementation of SLAP2 and neuronal reconstruction in pyDynamo. 

Included in the /src is the many scripts that runs the training based on the type of experiment one would do.

The deep learning models uses modules created by MONAI and the augmentation uses the torchIO library.
